[This will build a docker image as described in Dockerfile, also make sure that docker is 
running when running this command.]

To start the container from the image
-------------------------------------

docker run -p 3000:3000 c332fefe63fc60ff349d38741a1033837cea0b194dd12f98c714530bf2a80b1f

[-p is used to map the docker port 3000 to localhost OS port 3000 so that we can access the application 
directly from the local browser.]

open another terminal

> docker ps
